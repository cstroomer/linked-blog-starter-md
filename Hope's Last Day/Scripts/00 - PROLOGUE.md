# Introduction
Light-years from Earth, orbiting a binary star, we see a massive planet -- a gas giant. Dwarfed by the planet's colossal mass, we see a small rocky moon completely wrapped in cloud. 

As we push in toward this moon we penetrate the dense, grey cloud. Then, as we leave behind the cold, unsettling silence of the void, we are immediately assaulted by this world's forbidding climate. A fierce wind and caustic rain howl and lash at us, and the clouds -- below, above and all around -- ripple with electrical activity.

As we descend, we see the interconnected modular structures common to most extra-solar colonies across known space. At the northern end of the colony, a wall projects 20 meters into the air to shelter the colonists and their home from the battering storms. In the distance, we see the man-made mountain of ceramic and steel of the colony's [[atmosphere processor]] radiating its characteristic pale, blue light. 

This is a our story of the final hours of [[Hadley's Hope]], the doomed colony better known as LV-426.

# What's the story Mother?
[[Hadley's Hope]], a jointly funded by [[Weyland-Yutani]] and the [[United Americas]], has a bit of an "us and them" feel to it with visiting corporate types tending to look down their noses at the colony's residents -- the labourers, surveyors, mechanics and analysts that keep the lights on. Despite all that, the colony's been developing rather well.
